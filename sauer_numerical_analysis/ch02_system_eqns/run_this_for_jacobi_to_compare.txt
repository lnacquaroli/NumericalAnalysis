One step of an iterative method will require approximately
2 Ã— 4n = 800,000 operations, two for each nonzero matrix entry. We could do 100
steps of Jacobi iteration and still finish with fewer than 108 operations, which should
take roughly a second or less on a modern PC. For the system just defined, with n =
100,000, the following Jacobi code jacobi.m needs only 50 steps to converge from a
starting guess of (0, . . . ,0) to the solution (1, . . . ,1) within six correct decimal places.

The 50 steps require less than 1 second on a typical PC.
